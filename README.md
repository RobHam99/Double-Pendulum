# Double-Pendulum
Double pendulum simulation using pygame.  

A double pendulum is an example of a fairly simple chaotic system. I learned about it in my Mathematical Physics module in 3rd year university. I learned about   
how to calculate the Euler Lagrange equations. However I wanted to visualise the problem so I decided to write this code for a double pendulum.

There is no air resistance so I believe thats why it spins out of control at high gravity.
